1. Are the operators (e.g. /, /I, **, %) used the same way?
   1. For Python // means integer division while for Java its used for commenting
2. Do string operations like + and * behave the same?
   1. For both Python and Java, the + and * mean the same thing (adding and multiplying)
3. How are variables declared and updated?
   1. Python: variable_name = value
   2. Java: int variable = 2, variable = 3
4. Are types required, or can you assign freely?
   1. For Java you have to declare types while Python is free
5. What happens when an error occurs?
   1. Java and Python: It doesn’t run and tells the type of error
6. How is the error shown or handled in each language?
   1. Java: The error is shown and traced back to the code line in Java
   2. Python: raises an exception which is a special type of object that represents the error
7. Are true/false written the same?
   1. Python: True and False
   2. Java: true and false

10. Are keywords or formatting different?
   1. Yes
11. How does each language group lines of code (indentation, braces, etc.)?

   2. Java: {}, uses semicolon for statement ends ;, 
12. How is a simple loop written and displayed?

   2. Java: for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
13. Which language was easiest to understand?
   1. Python
14. Which had the clearest output or errors?
